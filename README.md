Hi, I'm Muhammad Umer Sajid 👋
🚀 About Me
I'm an enthusiastic tech innovator with a passion for creating impactful solutions in the fields of IoT, embedded systems, and industrial safety. My work revolves around leveraging cutting-edge technologies to build efficient and cost-effective devices that solve real-world problems.

💻 What I Do
Embedded Systems Development: I've worked extensively with microcontrollers like ESP32, Arduino, and STM32, integrating them with sensors and modules for various applications.

IoT Solutions: I specialize in IoT-based monitoring systems, including a project where I developed an air quality meter for industrial safety, utilizing sensors and ESP32 to send data to an SQL database.

Hardware Design: From voltage regulators like the LM2596-5.0 to custom-built Wi-Fi devices, I design hardware that connects and communicates seamlessly.

Software Development: Proficient in C++ and Embedded C, I have experience building both terminal-based applications and advanced software solutions.

Technical Mentorship: I enjoy giving back to the community by mentoring students and helping others with technical and non-technical tasks.

📚 Currently Working On
Smart Device Design: Creating a multifunctional device that combines a power supply, function generator, oscilloscope, and component tester.

Advanced Camera Projects: Developing a portable device similar to the Visia Skin Analysis system for capturing high-quality images and wirelessly sending them for processing.

Educational Workshops: Conducting workshops to share my knowledge with upcoming engineers and technologists.
